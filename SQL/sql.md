# What is a database?

- A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.
- In order to manage our databases, we use a software application called **Database Management System (DBMS)**.
  - We connect to a DBMS and give it instructions for querying or modifying data.
  - The DBMS will execute our instructions and send results back.
- DBMSs can be classified into two categories
  - Relational
    - We store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships.
    - We use SQL to work with these RDBMSs.
  - NoSQL
    - They donâ€™t understand SQL.
