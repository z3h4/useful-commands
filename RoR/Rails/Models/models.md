# ActiveRecord
- In Active Record, 
  - Objects carry both persistent data and behavior which operates on that data.
  - Data access logic is part of that object.

# Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
- ORM is a technique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a RDBMS.
- Using ORM, the properties and relationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less overall database access code.
